# Note Taker


## Description 

---

Note Taker is a web application that stores notes onto a local database. I was motivated to build this application to explore the technical concepts of database storage, server operation, and integrating JavaScript, Node.js, and it's various modules. This sort of project was a perfect concept to try out all of those things. The application is able to store typed in notes onto your computer with the help of a JSON database. So this is more secure than simply saving it onto the local storage. Through the process of making the application, I learned a lot about node.js and it's modules like express.js. I also learned a great deal about servers and how they operate behind the scenes.

In order to use the application, a user begins by clicking the "Get Started" button. This leads the user to the notes page. Here, you type in the title of the note followed by the body content. Once you have finished typing your note, you click the save icon  in the top right corner of the screen and it will be saved to the database and kept displayed on the sidebar. You can access each of these notes by clicking on the note title in the sidebar and it will populate the screen.
